Features:
 - Headless mode (--headless): Allow you to use Grayjay from your browser instead, while still allowing system, login, and captcha dialogs. (Assumes local)
 - Changelog support
 - Hotkey (i) now minimizes the player alongside esc
 - Sidebar on left side of video (hover left if in theater mode)
 - Developer Portal support (Add "DEV" file to executable directory)

 - Server mode (--server): Allows you to use Grayjay from a server in your browser, binds to all ips, DISABLES system, login, and captcha dialogs. (Assumes remote)
   WARNING: Server mode is still intended single-user, and has no security features built in yet, so not really intended to use yet unless you know what you're doing!

 - Unstable pipeline, can be used by modifying UpdaterConfig's server property by changing "Grayjay.Desktop" => "Grayjay.Desktop.Unstable"
   WARNING: Not recommended for most people, as there might be broken functionality in that release pipeline.
